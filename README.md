# Gauntlet Brawler

### This game is a personal project I quickly built to get better at Godot Engine and Game Development in general.

This is supposedly a "vampire survivors-like" type of genre.

For now, it has one enemy, some buffs you can get from leveling up, a level up system with exponential exp and gold.

### Sounds & Music used

This game has sounds and music from the website OpenGameArt.org.
